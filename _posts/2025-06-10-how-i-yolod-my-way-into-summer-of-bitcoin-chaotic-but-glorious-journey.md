Hey everyone! 👋  
I’m Aryan, a 3rd-year B.Tech CS undergrad, open source fanatic, part-time bug
squasher, and full-time community lurker. Today, I’m gonna spill the chai
about my wild ride into **Summer of Bitcoin 2025** — a journey full of _panic,
deadlines, accidental genius, and a few bugs that nearly gave me bugs in real
life_ 🐛💀.

## 🎬 Act 1: Spark of Madness

It all started in **October 2024**. I was _knee-deep in communities, Web3
projects, academics, and random YouTube tutorials at 2 AM_ — basically the
usual CS student starter pack.

That’s when I stumbled upon open source programs like **GSoC, LFX, and Summer
of Bitcoin** and thought,

> _“_ Heck yeah, let’s contribute to global projects while crying over DSA
> assignments!_”_

Fast forward to **February** , I was _sleep-deprived but determined_ , and I
finally applied to Summer of Bitcoin.

> **_Fun fact_** _: It took me_** _3 tries_** _, one emotional support Maggi
> packet, and 5000+ other students later — I GOT IN. 🎉_

## 🧠 Act 2: The Bootcamp Booty Kicker

We were assigned **4 assignments per week**. Sounds cute, right?  
WRONG.  
It was like trying to learn ancient Bitcoin wizardry while fighting bugs from
Mordor. 🧙‍♂️🔥There was:

  * 1 optional challenge (haha, as if that word means anything)
  * 3 mandatory ones that made my compiler cry
  * Countless late-night debug sessions powered by caffeine and confusion

But guess what? I SURVIVED. Somehow. Barely.

## 📑 Act 3: The Proposal Chaos Begins

Then came the **Proposal Round** — the _Hunger Games_ of open-source
internships. Out of thousands, only **174** of us made it through. _I felt
like the chosen one, until reality kicked in._

We had to:

  * Choose our orgs by April 9
  * Lock 3 orgs by April 12
  * Then re-select again before April 15
  * And THEN finally submit proposals by April 25

Sounds confusing? IT WAS.

Now, here’s the juicy part.  
On April 14 — **a new org LNPrototest magically appeared** like a rare
Pokémon. I wanted it BAD. But I had already locked my 3 orgs.  
So now I was:

  * Rejected from switching
  * Competing in an org with **49 people**
  * Stressed
  * Sleep-deprived (again)
  * Still hopeful (somehow)

So I did what any responsible student would do: **PANIC**.  
Then grind. Then message mentors. Then panic again.

## 🖌️ Act 4: UI, You and I

While others were chilling, my mentor shared an **image of a UI design**.  
That’s it. Just an image.

Something clicked. Maybe it was inspiration. Or sleep deprivation.

I said, “ _Bro let’s just prototype this!_ ”

I built a working UI, slapped it on my proposal, submitted everything, and
whispered to the open-source gods:

> _“_ Please let this work or I’ll cry into my terminal._”_

## My Organization Picks:

  * [**Lightning Network Daemon (LND)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sMNvxOYuTt4RLnAd0lCMBrGLLSdLoVFw8sIbZRYBeQU/edit?usp=sharing)
  * [**P2Pool v2**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/149_IujqH5hbIYanJhCBL2zBIVnDPD1bYVplah-DM1_4/edit?usp=sharing)
  * [**lnprototest**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gAlXtYyD4yXyp-IvBQd4U2hg8Hesmz86g4gTxyxiaws/edit?usp=sharing) (the most competitive of the bunch!)

## 🎉 Act 5: Result Day (aka Judgment Day)

🗓️ Date: May 5  
Mood: Terrified  
Playlist: “Apna Time Aayega” on loop

I opened the results.  
❌ Rejected by LND  
❌ Rejected by P2Pool  
✅ **ACCEPTED FOR LNPrototest!!!**

Cue the screaming, jumping, texting everyone I know, and a celebratory nap. 😴💃

## 🧠 TL;DR — But Make it Fun

  * **Applied** to SoB (after 3 tries 🥲)
  * **Survived** the Bootcamp of Doom
  * **Fought** my way through proposal jungle
  * **Randomly Prototyped** a UI (and somehow impressed the mentor)
  * **Got in** against all odds (and org locks)

Now, I’m **officially a Summer of Bitcoin contributor**. I’ll be working on
some cool LNPrototest magic and hopefully not break the internet.

## 🧠 What is lnprototest?

Let’s make it fun!  
Imagine you and your friends are playing with toy trains 🚂. For the game to
work, all trains must follow the **same rules** — stop at red lights, honk at
crossings, etc. If one train does its own thing, it crashes!

**lnprototest** is the **referee** that ensures all trains (i.e., Lightning
Network implementations) follow the rules.

## How It Works:

  1. Talks in a secret protocol (called **BOLT8**) with Lightning apps.
  2. Uses a custom Python “**Runner** ” to control the app.
  3. Sends test messages: “Say Hi!” → App responds “Hi!” ✅
  4. If the app misbehaves, the test catches it. ❌

It ensures Lightning apps around the world **interoperate safely and
reliably**.

## 🌟 Why This Matters to Me

This internship isn’t just about writing tests — it’s about contributing to
**financial freedom** and a **borderless, censorship-resistant future**.

As someone who started with open-source projects like **CircuitVerse** , this
felt like **leveling up** :

  * 🧠 Learning Bitcoin internals and network protocols
  * 🤝 Working with a global dev community
  * 💰 Earning a stipend in Bitcoin
  * 🚀 Building a future in open source + blockchain

I’m investing **175+ hours** into this internship and loving every bit of it!
