# Introduction

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm Devi Charan, and I am writing this blog to share my journey
on how I cracked Summer of Bitcoin 2025 . Trust me, it‚Äôs been quite a ride,
from late-night coding sessions to those ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments when things finally
clicked.

For SOB‚Äô25, I got selected to work on the ‚ÄúExtended message signing and
verification using On chain addresses‚Äù project with
[Zeus](https://zeusln.com/), and I am soo thrilled about it!

Let me tell you a bit about myself first. I‚Äôm currently studying Computer
Science at Scaler School of Technology, and I love building things with React,
JavaScript, TypeScript, and Django. I‚Äôve already worked at two startups as an
intern, but what really gets me excited is open source, decentralization, and
everything Bitcoin. I also love studying Operating systems and Networking.

# Discovering Open Source

You know how they say every journey has a beginning? Well, mine started in my
first year of college. Like most freshers, I was deep into DSA (Data
Structures and Algorithms), thinking that‚Äôs all there was to becoming a good
developer. But something felt missing. That‚Äôs when I realized that real-world
coding is about building actual projects that people can use. So, I jumped
into web development, starting with JavaScript.

The whole open-source world opened up to me when our college teachers
introduced us to it. They mentioned programs like GSOC, and our open source
club started hosting these super helpful sessions. But here‚Äôs where things got
interesting ‚Äî one of our instructors mentioned Summer of Bitcoin. I did some
quick research, and honestly, it felt like finding a hidden treasure. I just
knew I had to give it a shot.

# My First Attempt: Rejection & Lessons

My first attempt at SOB wasn‚Äôt exactly a success story, but it taught me a
lot! They kicked things off with this amazing one-month bootcamp where we dove
deep into blockchain, Bitcoin, and decentralization. I was completely hooked!
But then came the real challenge that would keep me up at night mining a block
from a mempool.

Here‚Äôs the thing, Bitcoin transactions aren‚Äôt just simple transfers. Each type
like P2PKH, P2SH, or SegWit comes with its own structure and rules.
Understanding and validating them programmatically is not an easy task. After
verifying each transaction, you need to mine a block, create something called
a merkle root, handle coinbase transaction, and deal with witness commitment.
I know, it sounds like a mouthful, right? At that time, I was just getting
started with basic projects, and trying to understand all these concepts, let
alone combining them into working code, felt like trying to solve a Rubik‚Äôs
cube blindfolded!

Those 25 days were some of the most intense of my life. The code just wouldn‚Äôt
work, and I was about to quit. Thank goodness for my friend (who‚Äôs also my
classmate), together we finally got it working. Looking back, it‚Äôs crazy to
think how something that seemed impossible then would become manageable a year
later.

I made it to the proposal round that year and, being comfortable with
JavaScript and React, I thought Zeus would be the perfect fit. The project was
about integrating CLN REST APIs into their codebase. But here‚Äôs where I messed
up, I spent too much time learning about things, setting up the dev
environment, getting used to it and not enough time actually implementing
them. Result? I got rejected. Yeah, it stung a bit, but you know what? That
rejection turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It made me look hard at
what I needed to improve, and those improvements helped me land my first
internship at a startup by the end of my first year.

# SOB 2025: New Format, New Me

Fast forward to this year, and SOB came with a whole new format. Four
assignments in four weeks, each one building on the last. Miss one week, and
you‚Äôre out. No pressure, right? üòÖ But here‚Äôs where all that previous struggle
paid off. The first assignment? Building a basic Bitcoin transaction that sent
100 BTC with a message ‚ÄúWe are all Satoshi!!‚Äù embedded in the blockchain. I
knocked that one out in just a day, what a confidence boost!

The second week brought us into multisig territory with P2SH-P2WSH addresses
(I promise these aren‚Äôt just random letters!). It was definitely trickier, and
took me about 2‚Äì3 days to figure out. But then came week three, the block
mining challenge. You know what‚Äôs funny? It was almost identical to the
assignment that had me pulling my hair out the previous year. But this time
around, even though it was still challenging, I could actually see the path
forward. Sure, I still struggled trying to fit transactions into a block while
following Bitcoin‚Äôs rules, but I managed to solve it in about a week. It felt
like clear proof of growth.

Looking at these two experiences side by side really showed me how far I‚Äôd
come. The same challenge that once had me sleeping only 4‚Äì5 hours a night for
weeks was now something I could tackle with much more confidence. Don‚Äôt get me
wrong, it wasn‚Äôt exactly easy this time either, but at least I wasn‚Äôt
questioning my life choices at 3 AM anymore! üòÑ

# Proposal Chaos and Acceptance

After conquering all those assignments, I was ready for the next challenge. I
headed straight to Zeus to check out their project ideas. Two of them really
caught my eye: ‚ÄúView connected and disconnected peers in Zeus‚Äù and ‚ÄúExtending
Message Signing & Verification with On-Chain Address Keys‚Äù. But when I joined
the Zeus community, I got hit with this wave of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
There were already participants, raising PRs and even giving demos! Someone
had already started working on that peers project I was interested in.

But then I noticed something interesting, nobody was touching the Extended
message signing project. It was like finding an unopened present. I didn‚Äôt
think twice, I jumped right in. First things first, I dove into research mode,
learning everything I could about Bitcoin RPCs and APIs that could help build
this thing. You know that feeling when you‚Äôre so excited about something that
you can‚Äôt wait to start? That was me! I got my dev environment set up faster
and started coding away.

I managed to put together a quick demo and raised a PR. The implementation
wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was pretty close to what they were looking for. Here‚Äôs
the thing though ‚Äî I knew one PR wasn‚Äôt enough to show what I could really do.
So I started hunting for other issues to work on and found some, fixed them,
and got those PRs merged. But I never took my eyes off that message signing
project, I integrated backends for different types of node implementations and
made the UI better !

Now, here‚Äôs where things get a bit funny (or scary, depending on how you look
at it). I was so caught up in building and coding that I completely forgot
about writing the actual proposal! When it hit me, I had just 4 days left
before the deadline. Talk about a panic moment! I was sitting there, staring
at my screen, wondering how on earth I was going to turn all my work into a
proper proposal. I spent an entire day just reading through successful
proposals from alumni (thank goodness for those!), picked up some ideas from
2‚Äì3 of them, and finally wrote mine.

> project-proposal_](https://guide.summerofbitcoin.org/the-proposal-
> round/writing-a-winning-project-proposal) _  
> You can refer this page for writing a good proposal and example proposals._

Then came the waiting game. You know that feeling when you‚Äôre both super
confident and totally nervous at the same time? That was exactly my state of
mind. I knew I‚Äôd put in the work, but there was some serious competition out
there.

When the results finally came in‚Ä¶ I GOT SELECTED! I literally couldn‚Äôt believe
my eyes! All those late nights and debugging sessions had finally paid off. My
mentors at Zeus, [Evan](https://github.com/kaloudis) and
[Shubham](https://github.com/shubhamkmr04), sent their congratulations, and I
had my first meeting scheduled. I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî I was terrified it would be
like an intense technical interview, so I crammed all this Bitcoin stuff the
night before. But guess what? It turned out to be this really chill
conversation about getting to know each other. He even went through my PRs and
tech profiles and gave me some really helpful feedback.

# Building with Zeus: Real Contributions

I‚Äôm still working on the Extended message signing and Verification project,
which is almost wrapped up. But the cool part is, I‚Äôve also taken on another
exciting challenge: ‚ÄúCircular Rebalance of Channels‚Äù. Both these features are
pretty awesome and should make life easier for Zeus users. It‚Äôs amazing to
think how far I‚Äôve come from those sleepless nights trying to figure out my
first Bitcoin transaction!

# Key Takeaways from My Journey:

You know what‚Äôs funny about open source? It‚Äôs not just about writing code,
it‚Äôs about having conversations! One of the biggest lessons I learned is that
communication is absolutely key. Don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up, share your
ideas, and talk to your mentors. They‚Äôre there to help, not to judge!

When it comes to picking projects, here‚Äôs a golden rule I discovered: choose
something that makes you excited to jump out of bed in the morning. It is
important to make sure it‚Äôs something you can actually build. There‚Äôs no point
in promising to build a rocket if you‚Äôre still learning to ride a bike!

Here‚Äôs something that might surprise you, you don‚Äôt need to know everything! I
used to think I had to be some kind of Bitcoin genius before I could
contribute. But that‚Äôs not true at all. What matters is being honest about
what you know and being eager to learn what you don‚Äôt. Speaking of which,
don‚Äôt try to bluff in your proposals.

The real secret sauce? Consistency. Keep that initial excitement burning even
when things get tough. It‚Äôs like a marathon, not a sprint. Also, remember that
everyone started somewhere. Even the most experienced developers were
beginners once.

# Looking Forward:

I‚Äôm currently wrapping up both features I‚Äôve been working on, but I‚Äôm not
stopping there! I‚Äôve found some interesting feature requests that could
improve the Zeus app for users. You know that feeling when you use an app and
think ‚ÄúI wish it could do this‚Ä¶‚Äù? Well, now I get to be the person who makes
those wishes come true!

I‚Äôm committed to keeping up with our weekly check-ins , they‚Äôve been
incredibly valuable. There‚Äôs nothing quite like getting honest, sometimes
brutal feedback to help you grow. Here‚Äôs the cool part, even after the program
ends, I plan to keep contributing. This isn‚Äôt just a summer thing for me
anymore; it‚Äôs become part of who I am as a developer.

# For Future SOB Aspirants:

If you‚Äôre reading this and dreaming about cracking SOB yourself, I‚Äôve got your
back! Here are some resources that were absolute gold for me:

  1. [**Learn Me a Bitcoin**](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/): This site breaks down complex Bitcoin concepts into bite-sized pieces that actually make sense.
  2. [**The Bitcoin Whitepaper**](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) : Yes, it looks intimidating at first, but it‚Äôs like the Bitcoin bible. Take your time with it.
  3. [**Grokking Bitcoin**](https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin.html) :This book was a game-changer for understanding the technical stuff.
  4. **BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals)** : These are great for understanding how Bitcoin evolves and improves.

Remember, everyone‚Äôs journey is different, but I hope sharing mine helps light
the way for yours. The Bitcoin community is amazing, and there‚Äôs always room
for more passionate developers who want to make a difference!
