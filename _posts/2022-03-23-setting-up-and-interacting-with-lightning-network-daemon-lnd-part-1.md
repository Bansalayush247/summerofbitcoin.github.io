In this post, let's catch up with the recent advancements in **Bitcoin** and learn about the **Lightning Network**. üå†

Lightning Network is a **Layer 2** solution that helps to scale bitcoin transactions and get them settled at a lightning speed. The **Lightning Network Daemon** `(lnd)` - is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node that is capable of:

* creating channels
* closing channels
* managing all channel states
* maintaining a fully authenticated+validated channel graph.
* performing path finding within the network
* sending outgoing onion-encrypted payments through the network
* and much more...

I won't be getting much deep into the tech behind lightning network, as in this blog I want you to have some hands-on experience and enjoy a **coffee** bought on **lightning network**.

# Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

There are multiple ways to install `lnd`. In this tutorial I'll walk you through the installation where we build a development version from the source.

### Prerequisite for installing from source üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

Since lnd is written in `Go`, you need to install `Go` to use it.

**On Linux:**

```shell
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sha256sum go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz | awk -F " " '{ print $1 }'
```

The command should print  
`013a489ebb3e24ef3d915abe5b94c3286c070dfe0818d5bca8108f1d6e8440d2`

If it doesn't, then the target **REPO HAS BEEN MODIFIED**, and you shouldn't install this version of Go. If it matches, then proceed to install Go:

```shell
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

*Note: minimum version of `Go` supported is `Go1.15`*

Now you should set your `$GOPATH` environment variable, which represents the path to your workspace. By default, `$GOPATH` is set to `~/go`. You will also need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`. This ensures that your shell will be able to detect the binaries you install.  
Add the following to your `.bashrc` file, so as to save it for every new terminal instance.

```shell
export GOPATH=~/gocode
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

### Installing lnd from source ‚úîÔ∏è

Once you are done with the prerequisites, let's begin with installing `lnd`, `lncli`, and all related dependencies.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd
cd lnd
make install
```

In order to run, `lnd` requires, that the user specify a chain backend. Currently there are three available chain backends: `btcd`, `neutrino` & `bitcoind`.  
We'll be using `bitcoind` for our case.

You need to update your `bitcoin.conf` to enable lnd to communicate with bitcoind.  
Your `bitcoin.conf` file should have:

```shell
testnet=1
server=1
daemon=1
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
test.rpcport=8332
```

> Refer [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/share/examples/bitcoin.conf?ref=blog.summerofbitcoin.org) to learn more about the above options.

Still wondering about `zmqpubrawblock`? ü§î  
We need [ZeroMQ](Link) to know about the arrival of new blocks or transactions in bitcoind. The ZeroMQ facility implements a notification interface through a set of specific notifiers.

You need to provide some options to lnd too. Here also you have the choice to add them in `lnd.conf` file to prevent rewriting.

An ideal `lnd.conf` file should contain:

```shell
#for testnet
bitcoin.testnet=true
bitcoin.active=true
#set this for bitcoind chain backend
bitcoin.node=bitcoind
bitcoind.rpchost=127.0.0.1:8332
```

# Running LND üåã

Huh that was tough! But believe me your efforts will be worth it. üí™üèª  
To start the lnd node, open a new terminal and enter the command `lnd`.

> Note: Make sure you have bitcoind running in the background.

If you see such a response, **congrats** you did it! üéØ  
If not, then probably you missed something while setting up. I am always ready to help, just shoot your errors in the comments.

# Interacting with LND üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

Now that you have your `lnd` node up, lets create a wallet. Switch to a new terminal tab and hit:

```shell
lncli create
lncli unlock
```

We use `lncli` command to interact with our node. Let's try to get our node info.

```shell
lncli getinfo
```

**Boom! Error!** üòµ

`[lncli] could not load global options: unable to read macaroon path`

The error says that it is not able to read the `macaroon` path. **Macaroons** are Lnd's way to authenticate your node.

Running lnd for the first time will by default generate the `admin.macaroon`, `read_only.macaroon`, and `macaroons.db` files that are used to authenticate into lnd. They will be stored in the network directory (`default: lnddir/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet`)  
So this error could be resolved in two ways:

* Disble macaroons for testing purpose by passing --no-macaroons flag into both lnd and lncli
* Add the macaroon path manually by passing `--adminmacaroonpath` flag to lnd and  
  `--macaroonpath` to lncli. For eg:

`--adminmacaroonpath=data/chain/bitcoin/testnet/admin.macaroon`

So now when you hit the `getinfo` command you'll get all the data of your node like **`identity_pubkey`**, **`num_pending_channels`**, **`num_active_channels`** etc.
