Hey everyone! It’s Nandini, product designer (still in college, by the way!)
here, and wow, what a ride it’s been this summer. I’m buzzing with excitement
to share my journey as a mentee in **Summer of Bitcoin (SoB)** — seriously, if
you’re a young designer with a spark for innovation, you _have_ to check this
out next year!

Saving Satoshi — My Web3 design journey

# My SoB Journey: A Rollercoaster of Emotions

Getting into Summer of Bitcoin was a journey in itself, and honestly, it
started with **a classic “me” moment** of **minor panic and clumsy attitude!**
Before even getting to the proposal stage, we had a couple of assignments to
learn about Design in Bitcoin.

My first assignment was all about diving deep into wallet analysis, and you
can check out my work here:

Analysis**](https://www.behance.net/gallery/219886551/Wallet-Analysis)

Then came **Assignment 2** , where I continued exploring the Bitcoin design
landscape with Electrum:

Now, for the “oops!” moment. After submitting Assignment 1,

I got this email… a rejection!

My heart sank. Turns out, I had forked the repository and created a pull
request to submit my work, which is standard practice in open-source, right?
But for SoB, they wanted a direct submission. A quick reach-out to the admin,
and thankfully, it was all sorted. But trust me, that rejection mail was a
scary moment! It just goes to show, sometimes it’s the little things, but
don’t let them deter you from reaching out and clarifying!

# The Interview Marathon & Landing Saving Satoshi

After surviving the assignment round, it was time for proposals. I poured my
heart into two proposals, and guess what? I got interviewed for _both_ of
them! Talk about a confidence boost after that initial scare.

My proposals were:

  * [**Saving Satoshi Proposal**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6xWWunZ_B4hgeWOWnohnWuJN6xGhxxHW0-QOXcmNu4/edit?tab=t.0%5C)
  * [**Bitcoin Orbis Proposal**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQHtfWLaF6rn-fQ0mdLjO_F6N_2lSyoLVRgProvTN4s/edit?usp=sharing)

Ultimately, I got selected for **Saving Satoshi** , which I was absolutely
thrilled about! The project description instantly hooked me:

> **_Saving Satoshi — an educational bitcoin RPG_**
>
>  _Saving Satoshi is a light-hearted, interactive role-playing game (RPG)
> about bitcoin tech. While it’s been a great success, there has been some
> drop off where users lose interest and stop playing, particularly after
> chapter 3, when the game begins to incorporate more coding exercises. For
> this project, I’d be putting on my detective hat to find specific places in
> the game where user drop off is occurring and why. My goal? To design_**
> _research-based improvements_** _that,_**_by the end of summer_** _, will be
> fully integrated and_** _live in the production environment_** _._

This wasn’t just about designing; it was about understanding user behavior,
solving real problems, and making Bitcoin education more accessible and
engaging.

As a product designer, that’s exactly where my passion lies!

# Diving Deep: My Work So Far on Saving Satoshi

My journey with Saving Satoshi has been incredibly fulfilling. Before SoB, I
was **already pretty active in the Bitcoin design community** , contributing
by writing a **research plan for the Dana Wallet** and even making some **UIs
for the Bitcoin Core app**. This background gave me a solid foundation for
what was to come.

My main focus this summer has been **tackling the user drop-off after Chapter
3** in Saving Satoshi. This is where the game introduces more coding, and
naturally, some users hit a wall. My mentors, **Lee Gordon** and **Deeksha
Satapathy** , have been phenomenal, guiding me every step of the way. And of
course **Stacie** always there to guide, support and encourage my ideas.

To continue working on**Christoph’s** work was an honor in itself as him being
an experienced designer for mor than decades unlike me a newbie compared of
him.

I got connected with the first product manager, **ecurrencyhodler**(Andrew),
and gathered his point of view on the project.

Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve been up to:

**User Research, My Way:** I’ve been on a mission to understand _why_ users
are dropping off. This involved extensive user interviews with a diverse group
of participants. You can see some of the raw insights I’ve gathered and
analyzed using tools like Claude AI for pattern recognition in my **User
Interview Documents** (Tejas Ashri, Rashi Jyotishi, Shivansh Bhatnagar, Ayush
Bansal, Anoushka Jha, Eshaan Aggarwal, Saumya). It’s been an eye-opening
experience, truly putting myself in the users’ shoes.

**Crafting Research Tools:** I designed dynamic survey forms on **Survey JS**
to gather quantitative data and structured interview questions to delve into
qualitative insights.

Here’s a peek at one of the dynamic survey forms I created:
**Dynamic**[**Survey
Form**](https://surveyjs.io/published?id=c64e2782-6a40-4435-9c6e-3afc6203cb0f)

**Problem Identification:** Through detailed qualitative and quantitative
analysis, I’ve identified several key pain points. These include:

  * **Steep difficulty spikes** after Chapter 3.
  * **Unclear instructions** and ambiguous pseudocode in coding challenges.
  * **Insufficient and hard-to-find hints**.
  * Lack of **visual interaction** and engaging storytelling in later chapters.
  * **Technical barriers** like unclear error messages and progress not being saved.
  * And yes, those pesky **UI/UX navigation issues** where users couldn’t easily find buttons or hints!
  * **Brainstorming Solutions:** Based on the research, I’ve been brainstorming and proposing a ton of solutions. We’re talking about:
  * **Scaffolded learning pathways** to ease the difficulty curve.
  * A **redesigned hint system** with tiered, progressive hints that are actually discoverable.
  * **Enriched documentation and code examples** to make learning smoother.
  * Adding more **visuals and storyline elements** to keep the RPG vibe alive in later chapters.
  * Improvements to **error handling** and ensuring **progress is always saved**.
  * And of course, general **UI/UX optimizations** to make the whole experience seamless.

You can see a detailed breakdown of these findings and proposed solutions in
my **Saving Satoshi Chapter 4 UX Research Report**. (This is where the Claude
artifact comes in! I used it to organize and tag my research findings, making
it super efficient:
[Dashboard](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/0a0cdf11-1da4-43b4-9378-7c209cf9e935))

**Collaboration and Mentorship:** This entire experience has been a
masterclass in collaboration. Working with the Saving Satoshi team and my
mentors has not only honed my design skills but also my communication and
problem-solving abilities. It’s a true testament to the power of open-source
and community-driven development.

# What’s Next for This Bitcoin Design Enthusiast?

The summer is far from over, and my brain is overflowing with ideas! My
immediate future plans involve taking all the research and insights from the
report and actively applying them to design improvements for Saving Satoshi.
This means:

  * **Implementing Designs:** The next two months of my mentorship will be all about bringing these research-backed designs to life in Figma, creating tangible solutions for the pain points we’ve identified.
  * **A/B Testing & Iteration:** I’m super excited to conduct A/B tests on the new designs to see their real-world impact on user retention and engagement. It’s all about data-driven design, right? And iterating based on what we learn.
  * **Knowledge Sharing:** I’m committed to continually documenting all my ideas, whether they’re “crazy” or conventional, into a central file. This will serve as a valuable resource for future iterations and for anyone looking to contribute to Saving Satoshi. It’s all about paying it forward and building a stronger design community!
  * **Encouraging Young Talent:** I genuinely believe that Summer of Bitcoin is an incredible platform for budding designers, especially those interested in the fascinating world of Bitcoin. If you’re a product designer in college like me, don’t hesitate to apply next year. The experience, the mentorship, and the chance to contribute to impactful projects are truly invaluable.

My journey with Summer of Bitcoin has reinforced my belief in the power of
design to solve complex problems and make a real difference. The Bitcoin space
is ripe for talented designers, and I can’t wait to see what we build
together!

Stay curious, keep designing, and maybe I’ll see you in the Bitcoin design
community!
