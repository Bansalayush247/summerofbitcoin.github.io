**About the Program**

Summer of Bitcoin is a global online summer internship program that introduces university students to bitcoin open-source programming and design. You can learn more about how the program works on the Summer of Bitcoin website.

**My Journey**

I learned about this program in January 2023 through a friend at school. There are three phases to the application process: the screening round, the assignment round, and the proposal round.

*   **Screening Round:** We attended Zoom classes and had to maintain attendance to qualify for the next stage (We were given weekly reading materials and questions on different topics). Every week, we had meetups where we discussed these topics with our assigned groups and learned from each other. I successfully moved on to the assignment and proposal rounds.
*   **Assignment Round:** We were given a list of assignments to choose from and had to document our entire process. After completing the assignment, we advanced to the proposal round.
*   **Proposal Round:** We wrote project proposals based on the 2024 project ideas published by different organizations on their website. We could submit a maximum of three proposals.

I submitted three proposals, and one was selected. This is the project: Content Creation for Angor.

**About Angor**

Angor is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the robust foundations of Bitcoin, enhanced by the Nostr protocol for added security and transparency. It enables investors to maintain control over their funds throughout the investment process.

Description: Angor utilizes innovative time-lock contracts to release funds in stages, based on project milestones. This allows investors the flexibility to recover any unspent funds at any time. This mechanism ensures that the interests of investors and project founders are aligned, fostering a trust-minimized environment.

Skills Required: Design Thinking, Social Media, Content Creation

I did my research and created a detailed plan for my content creation process, which was the basis of my proposal.

Tip: Try to understand the project idea fully. If you have any doubts, reach out to your mentor for feedback.

**Selection Process**

Each organization had its own process for selecting interns. The Angor founder reached out to me soon after I submitted my proposal, as I had been contributing since the initial stages.

Soon after, this came in the email.

I was grateful for being selected! It was highly competitive with over 5,000 applicants from more than 50 countries that applied.

**Conclusion**

This marked the beginning of my Summer of Bitcoin journey. I was thrilled to be selected in the final results. One important aspect of this process was learning how to interact and bond with the community. People in open source are really helpful if you show your interest and eagerness to learn. However, no one will spoon-feed you; you have to sort things out on your own, learn, and make it work yourself.

Thank you for reading!

Stay tuned for my next blog post, where Iâ€™ll provide a detailed view of my workflow for this project idea.
