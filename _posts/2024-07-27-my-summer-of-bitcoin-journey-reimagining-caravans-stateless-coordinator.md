Hey everyone!

My name is Arilewola Sodiq, and I’m thrilled to kick off my Summer of Bitcoin with the Caravan project! Buckle up, because I’ll be taking you on a journey through the fascinating world of stateless coordinators and Bitcoin multisig wallets over the next few months.

But before we dive in headfirst, let’s get our bearings. Have you ever heard of the saying “not your keys, not your coins”? In the world of Bitcoin, this principle is paramount. Your Bitcoin wallet holds the private keys that unlock your digital currency. Keeping them safe and secure is crucial.

This is where multisig wallets come in. Imagine a vault requiring multiple keys to open — that’s the essence of a multisig wallet. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring several parties to approve a transaction. Pretty cool, right?

But managing these multisig wallets can be tricky. That’s where Caravan steps in. Their software acts as a stateless coordinator, essentially a digital tool that helps you easily manage your multisig wallets.

### So, what am I working on this summer?

I’m on a mission to reimagine the design of Caravan’s stateless coordinator application. Think of it as a complete makeover! My goal is to create an interface that’s not only user-friendly but also intuitive and visually appealing.

### Why is this important?

Think about it — Bitcoin can be intimidating for newcomers. A clunky, confusing interface can be a major roadblock to adoption. By streamlining the design, I want to make managing multisig wallets a breeze for everyone, from seasoned Bitcoin veterans to curious newbies.

### Stay tuned!

This summer promises to be an exciting adventure! Throughout the coming weeks, I’ll be documenting my progress on this project. Get ready for in-depth dives into the design process, challenges I encounter (and how I overcome them!), and of course, insights into the world of Bitcoin.

Whether you’re a seasoned Bitcoin user or just starting your crypto journey, this blog is for you! So, grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage), and let’s explore the fascinating world of stateless coordinators together!

We’ll take a deeper look into the Caravan project itself — what it does, how it works, and how you can get involved. Stay tuned!
