It was the summer of 2023, and intern hiring season was close to an end.
Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t bag an internship due to the ongoing recession. I
gave tons of OAs, applied to hundreds of companies, and still got no response,
but then came the Summer of Bitcoin as a ray of sunshine. In this article, I
will be sharing my journey as an intern at Summer of Bitcoin 2023.

# Shortlisting Process

The shortlisting process was divided into two parts:

  * Profile Shortlisting
  * Screening Assignment

## Profile Shortlisting

It is a very basic shortlisting process, and there are high chances of getting
shortlisted in this round.

> _Tip: Apply as soon as possible to increase your chance of getting
> shortlisted._

## Screening Assignment

There were two tracks in this yearâ€™s program.

  1. Designer Track
  2. Developer Track

We had to choose one of the tracks while applying. We received one or two
courses according to the track that we chose and had to complete them and
submit the certificates within 2 weeks. The shortlisted students get exclusive
access to the Summer of Bitcoin Discord server.

# Proposal Round

The shortlisted students from the previous rounds need to write a proposal on
a project of their choice. One can submit a proposal for at most three
projects. I was well versed in native iOS development, so I explored all the
projects and shortlisted two of them, one medium and one hard, which had Swift
as a prerequisite.

Even though I was aware of Bitcoin and how it worked at a high level, I wasnâ€™t
aware of the technicalities before the screening assignment. The screening
assignment proved to be a good resource, but that wasnâ€™t enough, as it had
very little information about the workings of the Lightning Network, which was
essential for one of the projects that I selected. Both of the projects were
related to Bitcoin wallets, so I read a lot about them as well as about the
Lightning Network. Understanding the technical stuff for the Lightning Network
was a big challenge for me; it felt a lot more complex than just the Bitcoin
Network.

I had my end-term exams at the same time, which made it a lot more difficult
for me to fully devote myself to the proposal round. Luckily, I managed to
submit the proposals on time. I continued to learn more about the technology
even after submitting the proposal, as I wasnâ€™t very confident that I would be
able to complete the hard-difficulty project if I got assigned to it.

Before the results, my mentor wanted to talk to me about the project. I
thought it would be an interview, so I prepared for it, but it turns out the
meeting was just to congratulate me and discuss a bit about my project. I was
on top of the world when I got to know that I was selected for the Summer of
Bitcoin internship, but I was terrified at the same time as it was a hard-
difficulty project and I hadnâ€™t wrapped my head around the Lightning
Development Kit (LDK) Framework (the framework I had to use for my project)
completely.

> as a lot of new programming concepts._

# Project Journey

The main journey starts here. The project to which I was assigned was a
combination of the two projects I had shortlisted. I was able to get the
common elements of the projects implemented within a week, but struggled to
figure out how to go ahead with integrating the LDK Lightning Node into my
project. It felt extremely difficult at the beginning, as there was no
documentation for Swift, and the Rust documentation felt completely foreign to
me.

Eventually, as the days passed, I started to learn more and more about the
framework through the [Bitcoin
Developers](https://www.youtube.com/@bitcoindevelopers/) YouTube channel, rust
and java example projects, and the documentation after understanding some rust
syntaxes. Each day I spent learning, I felt more confident, and within week
two, I was checking off the required outcomes as I continued to progress. I
was easily figuring out most of the things myself as I progressed, though for
some of the problems I spent days figuring out the solution. The LDK team and
my mentor provided very helpful suggestions for my problems.

I was finally able to complete my project way before the stipulated time.

> The joy of figuring out the solution after n days of zero progress is what
> will make you a good software engineer._

# Conclusion

This was one of the best and most productive summers that Iâ€™ve ever
experienced. It was not only a learning experience but also a confidence-
building experience. I never imagined that I would contribute to the future of
money this summer. Not only that, but the Bitcoin stipend and the swags were
just the cherry on top. ðŸš€
