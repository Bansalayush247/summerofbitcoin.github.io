Welcome back, Bitcoin comrades! Today, I will detour from the usual blog
format and dive headfirst into the fascinating world of design thinking. You
might be wondering, “Design thinking? What does that have to do with Bitcoin?”
Buckle up, because it is crucial in crafting an intuitive and user-friendly
experience for the Caravan stateless coordinator.

**Design Thinking: A User-Centric Approach**

Imagine designing a product without considering the people who will use it.
That’s a recipe for disaster! Design thinking combats this by placing the user
at the forefront of the entire design process. It’s a structured approach that
involves understanding user needs, brainstorming solutions, prototyping, and
iterating based on user feedback.

**So, how does design thinking apply to our stateless coordinator project?**

Here’s a breakdown of how I’m utilizing this approach to reimagine Caravan’s
UI:

**1\. Empathy: Understanding User Needs**

This phase is all about getting into the minds of caravan target users.
Through user interviews and competitor analysis, I’m gathering insights into
their pain points and preferences when managing multisig wallets.

**What are people struggling with?** Is it the process of creating a multisig
wallet? Is it the UTXO (unspent transaction output) visualization that’s
confusing? Knowing these pain points helps me prioritize features and
functionalities.

**2\. Define: Shaping the Project Scope**

Based on the gathered user data, I’m defining the core functionalities of the
redesigned stateless coordinator. This involves determining what features are
absolutely essential and which ones could be implemented further down the
line.

**3\. Ideate: Brainstorming Solutions**

This is where the creative juices start flowing! Here, I brainstorm various
design solutions to address user needs. From innovative ways to visualize
UTXOs to streamlining the transaction signing process, no idea is too
outlandish at this stage.

**4\. Prototype: Bringing Ideas to Life**

Here’s where things get tangible. Utilizing Figma, a design software, I create
low-fidelity prototypes that represent the core functionalities of the
redesigned UI. These prototypes are simple, focusing on layout and user flow
rather than aesthetics.

**5\. Test: User Feedback is Key**

The beauty of low-fidelity prototypes lies in their flexibility. I’ll be
conducting usability testing with real users, showing them the prototypes and
observing how they interact with the design. Their feedback is invaluable in
identifying any usability issues or areas for improvement.

**The Iterative Loop: Continuous Improvement**

Design thinking is an iterative process. After each round of user testing,
I’ll refine the prototypes based on the feedback received. This back-and-forth
process ensures the final design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also
intuitive and user-friendly.

**Next Steps: From Prototype to Reality**

In the next post, you’ll get a detailed information about how each of the
design thinking was used and the results I got through each phase.

So, stay tuned as we continue this exciting journey of reimagining the Caravan
stateless coordinator! In the meantime, feel free to share your thoughts on
design thinking. Have you ever encountered a product that clearly benefited
from a user-centric approach? Let’s discuss!
