Out of the 45 contributors accepted, 3 contributors will contribute as UX designers, and 42 contributors will contribute code as developers. Selected contributors come from countries around the world including Brazil, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Nigeria and United States. Like the previous year, the highest number of accepted contributors are from India. Details of the accepted contributors including their project proposals have been published at [Summer of Bitcoin 2023 Accepted Projects](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/program-details/2023/r/reckGTBbHuT6Amdhk).

All student contributors are paired with a mentor to begin planning their projects and milestones. Over the next few days, students will get acquainted with their mentors, engage with the project’s open-source community and finalize their project plans. Project period will continue through the summer until August 15. Students will also participate in weekly seminars to discuss the history of money, bitcoin fundamentals and philosophy and future developments on bitcoin. We look forward to hosting several talks from notable guest speakers in the bitcoin ecosystem. All student contributors will receive a stipend of $3000 in BTC on successful completion of their projects.
