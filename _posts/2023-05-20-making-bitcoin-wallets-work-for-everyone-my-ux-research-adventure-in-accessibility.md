## **Introduction**

Starting from May 15, 2023, my journey took an exciting turn as I kicked off a
three-month internship as a UX Researcher with the Bitcoin Design team. My
task? To make the user experience better for folks with visual disabilities,
specifically by improving how they can efficiently use the Lightning wallet.
This internship wasn‚Äôt just about gaining experience ‚Äî it was an opportunity
to contribute to a community that‚Äôs all about open-source teamwork in the
fast-paced world of digital money and blockchain. Along the way, I discovered
that this was more than just a job; it was a chance to explore how technology
can be inclusive and make a real impact.

## **Problem Statement**

This was a unique design challenge that allowed for complete creative freedom.
It required participants to conduct research and deepen their understanding of
accessibility. It‚Äôs worth noting that approximately 15% of the world‚Äôs
population experienced visual disabilities, underscoring the importance of
creating a Lightning wallet tailored to their needs.

## Expected Outcomes

  * Understand the user flow of a lighting wallet.
  * Research UX design solutions for people with visual disabilities. (For example someone who has poor vision or who cannot distinguish between color differences).
  * Design a lightning wallet with an onboarding flow and send flow for someone who is visually impaired. Resources

## First Few Weeks

In the initial weeks, I dedicated myself to comprehending the intricate
workings of Bitcoin and Lightning wallets. This phase involved immersive
sessions where I delved into the nuances of these technologies. Alignment
meetings with my mentor, Mo, provided invaluable insights, while our weekly
Tuesday sessions with fellow participants offered a collaborative space to
dissect Bitcoin‚Äôs historical evolution and its current landscape.

During this pivotal period, I meticulously outlined my timeline, carving out
distinct milestones that guided my journey. Through conversations and
interactions, I embarked on the exciting journey of initiating my UX process.
This marked the inception of a dynamic phase where research, engagement, and
strategic planning merged, propelling me forward in crafting a user experience
that would resonate with the visually impaired community.

## Milestones

  * M1 : Onboarding
  * M2 : Wallet Setup (Seed-Phrase & Wallet recovery)
  * M3 : Transfer

## Notable Achievements

The Theory of Cognitive Hierarchy : The concept of cognitive hierarchy within
touch-based applications is a guiding force in devising solutions that cater
to the needs of the visually impaired. Traditional hierarchy principles
heavily rely on visual cues such as color, position, and spacing ‚Äî elements
that hold little relevance for those without sight. The innovation of
cognitive hierarchy presents a groundbreaking approach to establishing order
and structure in designs that are accessible and meaningful for visually
disabled individuals.

The concept of simulating Braille on a flat display involves leveraging haptic
technology to transform any conventional flat screen into a functional Braille
display. By harnessing tactile feedback mechanisms inherent to the device,
this innovation empowers visually impaired individuals to perceive Braille
patterns on a screen, effectively bridging the gap between digital content and
touch-based accessibility.

In our daily interactions with handheld devices, visual cues guide our
experience. However, envision the interaction of a blind individual with the
same technology ‚Äî the display itself becomes redundant. Their interaction is
centered around VoiceOver and haptic feedback, rendering the display akin to a
blank canvas. The Blind Mode is a transformative solution that not only
deactivates the non-utilized display but also facilitates navigation through
VoiceOver and intuitive gestures. This innovation not only aligns with the
unique needs of visually impaired users but also conserves energy in the
process. When designing for the visually impaired, conventional principles
such as color schemes and visual hierarchy take a back seat. These concepts,
integral to typical design, are rendered irrelevant in this context, unveiling
a design landscape that challenges conventional norms.

## Helping hand

I am profoundly grateful to extend my sincere gratitude to my mentors:
Mogashni Naidu, Cristopher Ono, and Gary (The Blind Bitcoiner) for their
invaluable guidance and unwavering support throughout this journey. Gary, in
particular, has been an instrumental figure, generously sharing his expertise,
rigorously testing my solutions, and offering profound insights that have
indelibly shaped my design decisions. Their collective wisdom has been pivotal
in navigating the intricate challenges and opportunities within this project,
and their contributions have been instrumental in the realization of my
vision.

## Conclusion

This was my quick walkthrough of what all I did as a UX researcher at
[SoB‚Äô23](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/). I‚Äôd be very interested in talking
more about these milestones specific to those theories in coming blogs.
