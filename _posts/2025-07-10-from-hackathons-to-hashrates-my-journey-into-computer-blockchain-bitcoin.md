As of today, Bitcoin boasts a jaw-dropping market cap of **$1.2 trillion**.
Just to put that into perspective—the country I live in, **India** , has a
nominal GDP of around **$4 trillion**. Yeah, let that sink in. A single
decentralised digital asset is worth nearly a **quarter** of an entire
nation's economy. Wild, right?

This stark contrast was one of the first things that made me realize—**Bitcoin
isn’t just “magic internet money” anymore**. It’s a beast. A force. A
revolution.

But let's rewind a bit.  
Myself Om Swami — call me whatever, but tech has always been my thing.

I got into computers wayyyy before engineering even happened. I still remember
— it was **class 2nd** when my uncle, a computer engineer, brought a shiny new
computer home. And like any normal 2nd grader, I did what any sane kid would
do — **play games non-stop**. Hours of Roadrash, Counter Strike: Condition
Zero, Project IGI and the legendary GTA Vice City.

Then came **class 4th**.

That’s when my beloved game station crashed. Boom. Wouldn’t start. I was
devastated.

Enter my uncle with a magical CD. A few mysterious clicks, some loading
screens, and _voila_ — it was back. Fresh as new. I was fascinated.

I asked him, “**What did you just do?!** ”  
He explained — “Windows crashed. Probably some virus from all the secret
_sharing_ you’ve been doing with your friends. So I just formatted it.”

And that little spark lit something in me.

Of course, the virus-fetching adventures didn’t stop 😅. But slowly, I learned
how to **reinstall Windows myself** , **track down suspicious processes** ,
kill them, delete them — basically be the antivirus I wish I had.

And I didn’t stop there. I dove into **group policies** , **registry edits** ,
and **control panel sorcery**. Soon, I was the go-to tech guy in the family.
Friends, cousins, neighbors — you name it. If their PC misbehaved, I was the
fixer.

The best part? I was **allowed to make mistakes**. My uncle never stopped me.
He let me break things and then helped me understand what went wrong. That
freedom to fail fast was everything.

# Fast forward to JEE prep…

It was crystal clear — I had to pursue **Computer Engineering**. I gave my
best and cracked **JEE Mains with 98.3%ile in 2023**.

This led me to college, and that’s where things took a turn to real Coding……

# Sooooo… my journey into Blockchain actually began with a hackathon.

At IIIT Lucknow, I got introduced to blockchain thanks to **Axios** — our tech
society. Not long after, they organised **Hackofiesta-v5** , a 36-hour offline
intra-college hackathon. I jumped in with my team, and surprisingly — we
bagged a **special mention** and a **$150 prize**!

Not a fortune, but it hit different. It was **validation**. We were onto
something. That thrill of building something new and _getting recognised_ — I
was hooked.

Then came **Spheron Network’s hackathon**. This one was bigger, more
competitive, and guess what? We ended up **securing second place** with our
project **Serenity** — a decentralized stock exchange.

This wasn’t just fun anymore.

These early wins weren’t just about prizes — they made me believe in the
**real-world power of blockchain**.

# Then I stumbled upon Ethereum… and had questions.

While exploring Ethereum and smart contracts, I came across its big shift from
**Proof of Work** to **Proof of Stake**. At first, it sounded great — eco-
friendly, faster, all that jazz.

But the more I dug in, the more it felt… **centralized**. PoS seemed to favor
the wealthy — those with more tokens had more power. That didn’t sit right
with me.

# That’s when Bitcoin entered the chat.

Bitcoin’s **PoW model** stood tall. Yes, it’s energy-intensive. But it’s
**pure**. **Democratic**. You earn your validator spot by doing actual work,
not by just being rich.

That value of **decentralization** , of being **trustless yet trustworthy** ,
stuck with me.

That curiosity led me to something truly special — **Summer of Bitcoin**.

# And here I am.

From being the 4th-grade virus magnet to formatting PCs, from playing around
in control panel to deploying smart contracts, from local hackathons to
building decentralized systems — this journey has been wild, messy, and
amazing.

What started with games, bloomed into passion, and matured into purpose.

Currently, I’m working with **Fedimint** , contributing to the Bitcoin
ecosystem in a way I never imagined when I first touched a keyboard. It’s been
an eye-opener, and I’ll be sharing a detailed blog about my experience with
Fedimint very soon — so stay tuned!

Because this is more than tech.
