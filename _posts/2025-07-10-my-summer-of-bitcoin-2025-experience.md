Hello Everyone, I am Ayush Saksena, I will walk you through my incredible
experience at [Summer of Bitcoin
2025](http://summerofbitcoin.org/2025-accepted-projects) where I worked for
[Breez](http://breez.technology).

# **My Background Includes —**

I am Sophomore at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and
Manufacturing Jabalpur, India. I have background in AI/ML and Application
Development with some projects at hand and an award at a National level
Competition. I had recently developed interest in Blockchain and was planning
to make projects. Then I was introduced to [Summer of
Bitcoin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/summer-of-bitcoin/) in a session by
our college seniors. It made me think, what’s better to learn than by cracking
a Globally Recognized Program ?

So, sit comfortably in the passenger seat as I drive you across the next 5
months which were not easy to say the least.

# **Summer of Bitcoin 2025 Timeline —**

It is a multiple stage process, bear with me, this will take significant time
and rigorous testing before you even become eligible to apply to the
Organizations.

  * **Application Period —**

This was a sort of initial shortlisting round where you were required to fill
a form with your basic details like Github, LinkedIn and a Paragraph about why
you want to join this program?

This was open for 15 days after which your selection for Learning Bootcamp was
notified via Email.

**What I learnt ?**

It helped me pen down my goal and expectations from this program before it
even began which is a great approach in daily life too.

Invitation Mail

  * **Learning Bootcamp —**

This was a four-week intense Program where I was given an assignment which I
had to pass before the end of every week. Only after the success of previous
assignment, was the new assignment given.

This was honestly the most difficult part of the process because of the
timing. It clashed with my Semester examinations so I was giving my
Examination in afternoon, working on the assignment entire evening and pulling
all nighter to study for the examination next day.

[Adi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adi-shankara-608610216/), Summer of Bitcoin
Organizer, noticed this and made the 4th test optional. Huge thanks to him !!

**What I learnt ?**

I learnt Grit. I was able to push myself to the extreme and it made me realize
my potential and how much I can achieve just by using my time wisely. I also
learnt lot about how Bitcoin works and Blockchain in general.

Advancement to Proposal Round

**Proposal Round —**

After completing all the tests in the bootcamp, I became eligible to apply to
the Organizations. We were asked to lock 3 organizations to which we will give
our proposal.

I read all the projects and chose
[**Breez**](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/orgs-
details/breez/r/rec1fkYxPN8pxteHq),
[**Galoy**](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/orgs-
details/galoy/r/recMhe9qMXcLdEQeg) and
[**LND**](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/orgs-
details/lnd/r/rec9K42Y6shmbvXfZ) in order of the projects I liked.
Simultaneously, at this time, we were having quizzes, viva and lab exams. So I
was not able to make PR on any of these, which is recommended to get to know
the orgs better.

I looked at all 3 orgs and their codebase and finalized
[**Breez**](http://summerofbitcoin.org/orgs-
details/breez/r/rec1fkYxPN8pxteHq). Due to time constraints, I decided to go
all in in one org only. I wrote detailed proposal after researching about
[**Breez**](http://summerofbitcoin.org/orgs-
details/breez/r/rec1fkYxPN8pxteHq).

You can see my Proposal here —
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3ZCnE2K9pW1I3mOf45EUCYoM6osa6gCN0cAvcCIYe0/edit?usp=sharing>

**What I learnt ?**

I learnt to present my solution in detailed way with the help of flowcharts
and demo code. It was first time writing a proposal. I got to know lot about
[**Breez**](http://summerofbitcoin.org/orgs-
details/breez/r/rec1fkYxPN8pxteHq).

  * **Proposal Review Period —**

I kept my fingers crossed during this period which lasted a week. I almost
forgot about it as my End Semester Exams came up during this period so I had
to focus entirely on them to pass the Semester.

  * **Result —**

My Examinations ended on 5th May, 2025. That evening I went to watch movie
with my friends and then suddenly the mail came, ‘ _Summer of Bitcoin:
Congratulations!’_ and I wasn’t able to process it for few moments. Then it
hit me, I made it. Finally this rigorous testing paid off.

I am grateful to my parents,

[BitByte-TPC IIIT Jabalpur](https://medium.com/u/cfc201e168f3?source=post_page
---user_mention--093f9985777f---------------------------------------)

and my friends for being constant source of encouragement.

I thought it was the best but little did I know it was yet to come.

The Breez SDK provides developers with an end-to-end solution for integrating
self-custodial Lightning payments into their apps and services, eliminating
the need for third parties and simplifying the complexities of Bitcoin and
Lightning.

  * My Project —

Add Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) Protocol as Modular, Optional component in
Breez SDK. This will enable seamless interface for sending and receiving
payments. Along with documentation and demo website implementation. In easier
words, current system is scan to pay, I am tasked to provide users with
connection string that they can enter anywhere and payment will be done, thus
saving the hassle of the user to enter details manually.

My work so far -

  * Culture —

I got the opportunity to talk to **Roy Sheinfeld** , **Breez Co-Founder and
CEO**. He was very encouraging and introduced me to the super cool project
mentor,
[**Antonio**](https://nosta.me/npub162s058cnjmawtzynnej2r9v5mn4gez90rsrl2zw8pc0qcsrh83eq3emsh2).
Throughout the project, [Antonio](http://linkedin.com/in/hydra-yse) has helped
me grow in numerous ways, he helped me understand complicated concepts while
making sure I learn from this experience. Guiding me and be available round
the clock to handle all my doubts, even the most basic ones while Providing me
the correct resources to study from are just some of the many things he helped
me with. He made me feel comfortable with doing mistakes and learning from
that experience. He never pressured me about any of the deadlines and still
our work stayed ahead of decided timeline.

I am very grateful to be under his guidance. He represents the Org’s overall
**Positive Environment of Growth along with Learning**. Working for
[Breez](http://breez.technology) is the best part in my whole experience. I am
very grateful to Summer of Bitcoin for providing me this opportunity and
everyone who helped me make the chain of right decisions to land here.
