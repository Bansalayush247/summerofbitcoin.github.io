## Introduction:

This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to be part of Summer of Bitcoin. It was a thrilling journey filled with learning, challenges, and growth, and I'm excited to share my story with you.

## Discovering CLNapp and More:

At Summer of Bitcoin, I worked on CLNapp. This app is designed to manage core lightning nodes remotely with all the latest RPC commands. You can receive and send Bitcoin both on-chain and via the lightning network (off-chain).

## A Mentor Who Guided Me: Vincenzo Palazzo:

One of the most valuable parts of my internship was having Vincenzo Palazzo as my mentor. Vincenzo patiently guided me through every aspect whether it is simple `git rebase` or the Lightning Network commands, which is like a special highway for Bitcoin transactions. Whenever I had questions, no matter how small, Vincenzo was there to help me out.

## How I Started Contributing: Taking the First Steps in the World of Development:

When I first began my internship at Summer of Bitcoin, the prospect of contributing to real-world projects felt both exciting and daunting. However, my journey started with a simple yet effective strategy that gradually built my confidence in the world of development.

## Exploring Pre-SoB Issues: The First Leap:

My mentor, Vincenzo Palazzo, introduced me to a set of issues labeled as "pre-SoB." These issues were intentionally designed to be approachable for newcomers like me. They acted as stepping stones, allowing me to dip my toes into the world of coding and problem-solving without feeling overwhelmed. These initial tasks provided me with a sense of accomplishment as I successfully resolved them one by one.

## Building Confidence, One Issue at a Time:

Fixing these "pre-SoB" issues might have been small victories, but they played a significant role in boosting my confidence. As I tackled each issue, I learned how to navigate through the codebase, understand the project's structure, and apply solutions effectively. These small wins showed me that I was capable of making meaningful contributions, setting the stage for more complex challenges ahead.

## Embracing the Learning Process:

Contributing wasn't just about solving problems; it was also about learning. Each issue I tackled brought with it a chance to explore new concepts specifically in lightning. Mistakes were growth opportunities, and every piece of feedback from my mentor became a valuable lesson for improvement.

## Innovative Add-ons: Plugins like Folgore:

One of the highlights was exploring plugins that Vincenzo Palazzo had created for the Lightning Network, particularly "[Folgore](https://github.com/coffee-tools/folgore) and [btcli4j](https://github.com/clightning4j/btcli4j)". These plugin made using the Lightning Network much easier, even for those who aren't tech experts. It's like finding a hidden gem in the world of Bitcoin.

## About my contributions

### Lightning Wallet Functionality:

Manage a core lightning node with a modern and easy-to-use application.

#### Invoice and BTC Address Generation:

CLNapp simplifies the process of generating invoices and Bitcoin addresses for receiving funds. Through a few straightforward steps, users can effortlessly create unique invoices and addresses, enhancing the user experience and facilitating seamless transactions.

## Future goals

As I write this, I'm working on something exciting – integrating support for the "bkpr-listincome" plugin via the grpc interface for the [core lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) project. This plugin is designed to help users keep track of their incoming and outgoing Bitcoin transactions, making it simpler and more organized.

## Closing the Chapter: An Unforgettable Experience:

My time at Summer of Bitcoin has been truly transformative. I started as someone who barely knew the basics, and now I'm confident about diving into the complex world of Bitcoin technology. The journey doesn't end here – I'm eager to keep learning and contributing to making a positive impact in the world of Bitcoin.
