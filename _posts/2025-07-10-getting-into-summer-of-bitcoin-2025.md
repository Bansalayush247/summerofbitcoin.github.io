Hey everyone!  
I’m **Rohan Chandra Sen** , and I’m beyond thrilled to share something that
still feels surreal, I got selected for **Summer of Bitcoin 2025** , and I’m
working on a mind-blowing project with **Braidpool!**

# 🧑‍💻 How It All Started

Back in January 2025, I was deep into a bunch of side projects. I’d been
exploring **Web3** , building **decentralized** **apps** , working with
**Rust** **microservices** , and playing around with **AI tools**. But I felt
like I was missing something, a place where I could **merge open-source
contribution, Bitcoin, and cutting-edge AI** in a meaningful way.

Here comes **Summer of Bitcoin**.

I’d heard about it from some seniors and random posts on LinkedIn. The moment
I saw the SoB website, I knew I had to try. The idea of working with **Bitcoin
core infrastructure** , learning from the OGs, and contributing to real-world
impact? Count me in! 😤

# 📚 The Assignments: The Journey Begins

SoB doesn’t just hand you the opportunity, you _earn_ it.

I started with the Week 1 assignments, and let me tell you — it wasn’t just
your average Leetcode grind. From **mining a block** ⛏️ to diving deep into
how **Bitcoin transactions work,** each week made me feel more and more like I
was **unlocking a new level** of the blockchain universe.

Week 3, the toughest one, pushed me to optimize a **P2Pool client**.
Debugging, documenting, and pulling all-nighters was now part of the routine.
But weirdly enough, I was loving it. Like, actually enjoying being sleep-
deprived because I was learning something crazy cool 😅

# 📝 The Proposal: My Big Brain Moment

Once I cleared all the assignments, came the big boss fight: **the proposal
round**.

This is where I discovered **Braidpool,** a decentralized mining pool using
Bitcoin’s smart contracts. But what _really_ got me hooked was their idea for
an **AI-assisted coding tool** for Bitcoin development.

> _“What if I could build something like GitHub Copilot, but specifically
> trained on Bitcoin code, conversations, and culture?”_

I had already worked on similar RAG-based AI tools. So I poured every ounce of
energy, research, and caffeine I had into crafting a solid proposal.

_✅ Build a project-specific RAG  
✅ Train on IRC, BitcoinTalk, Dev Mailings  
✅ Add FIM (Fill-In-Middle) AI tooling  
✅ Hook into compilers and linters like YouCompleteMe  
✅ Make it _local-first _with LLMs like DeepSeek, QwQ, Phi4  
✅ Even add a VSCode extension_

# 🎉 The Selection: A Dream Come True

Fast forward to May.  
One sleepy Monday afternoon, I casually opened my inbox and there it was…

📩 _“Congratulations, you’ve been selected!”_

It was **official,** I was going to be working with Braidpool for SoB 2025!

# 🤔 What I’m Working On

My project is titled **Bitcoin AI-Assisted Coding Tools** under the mentorship
of **Bob McElrath**. The goal?  
Make Bitcoin development easier, smarter, and less error-prone by building a
suite of AI tools trained _specifically_ on Bitcoin knowledge.

Here’s what I’ve been cooking up this summer:

# 🔎 1. Project-Specific RAG and Agentic AI

Ingest entire Bitcoin codebases, docs, and dependencies, and enable smart
semantic retrieval.

# 💬 2. Chatbot RAG

Trained on real Bitcoin discussions — IRC, mailing lists, bitcointalk. Think
of it as “Bitcoin GPT with a soul”.

# ✍️ 3. Code FIM Tool

Suggests _middle parts_ of code using context-aware AI, tightly integrated
with compilers and linters.

# 🤖 4. Multi-Shot Code Generation

Use multiple local LLMs to brainstorm, refine, and finalize code snippets
using “architect” mode like Aider.

# 🧩 5. VSCode Extension

Package everything into a dev-friendly extension to make Bitcoin coding
seamless.

The best part? It’s all happening **offline-first** using **local LLMs +
Ollama —** keeping it private, cost-efficient, and hackable.

# 🧠 Why It’s Exciting (and Scary)

This project has me genuinely hyped. I’m not just building another tool — I’m
building something that **bridges AI with the most decentralized financial
technology ever created**.

And yeah, it’s scary too.

The stakes are high. Bitcoin devs are **serious people** — you can’t just
throw half-baked AI code suggestions and expect it to fly. That’s why I’m
rigorously testing everything: retrieval precision, hallucination scores, code
correctness, and more.

But that pressure? That’s what keeps me going.

# 💭 Reflecting on the Journey So Far

Honestly, getting into SoB wasn’t just about the title or the stipend. It was
about **validation**. Validation that all those hours spent building obscure
side projects, attending open-source calls, helping others debug — it _meant_
something.

Working on Bitcoin AI dev tools has made me a better programmer, researcher,
and (unexpectedly) a better writer too.

And more than anything, it’s reminded me that I don’t have to wait to
“graduate” to do meaningful work.

_See You soon! Sayonara_ 👋
