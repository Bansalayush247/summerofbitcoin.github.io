Hey Guys, This is Keshav, a pre final year computer science student from PEC
Chandigarh, India. Today I am gonna walk you through my first part of Summer
of Bitcoin 2025 journey.

So lets not waste any moment and dive right into it !!

# **WHAT IS SUMMER OF BITCOIN ?**

Summer of Bitcoin is a global, online summer internship program focused on
introducing university students to bitcoin open-source development and design.
Students spend 12 weeks during the summer contributing to an open-source
project, earn bitcoin as stipend and put their summer break to good use.

# **SHORTLISTING PROCESS : -**

The **Summer of Bitcoin** selection process typically follows a structured
format:

  1. **Initial Application & Screening**  
Applicants choose a track (Developer or Designer) and submit portfolios or
coding samples, previous open source contributions,etc. Applicants are
shortlisted for next phase based on their profile.

  2. **Learning & Bootcamp Phase**  
After passing screening, candidates join a month long dedicated online
learning bootcamp. This involves reading foundational Bitcoin materials
followed by weekly eliminatory coding tests for Developers Track. This year
there were only 3 weekly coding tests.

  3. **Proposal Round**  
A curated list of project ideas from partner organizations are published, and
applicants can submit up to three project proposals by a specified April
deadline. They are encouraged to connect with mentors to refine their
proposals.

  4. **Interviews & Organization Matching**  
Some organizations conduct a short technical assignment or interview. A
successful mentor will reach out, evaluate your proposal depth, domain fit,
and readiness for sustained internship work

  5. **Final Selection**  
In 2025, 68 student contributors from 9 countries are contributing to 33 open-
source bitcoin organizations.

It was a very unique and challenging experience for me as I was also doing a
full time internship while managing my SoB commitments. It all started with
just a random LinkedIn notification lol. When I was shortlisted for proposal
round, it suddenly got a bit overwhelming because my tech stack always
revolved around Python and AI and majority orgs targetted RUST, JAVASCRIPT,
etc . I explored Golang though for fuzzing project meanwhile and enjoyed every
bit of it but then i came across my current mentor Bob from Braidpool
Organization where he suggested some AI inclusive ideas which can be
integrated in bitcoin space and BOOM! That was my opening !!  
I started engaging in the discussions, did my homework if i wasn't aware of
anything being discussed in the server, wrote some competency test codes and
of course wrote a cool proposal for my AI Assisted Coding Tool For Bitcoin
Devs Project.

Allright Guys, this was just a brief introduction, I will be back soon with my
current progress on the project.

Stay Tuned!  
Cheers
