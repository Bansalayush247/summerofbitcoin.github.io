On a random Thursday evening I got a notification from
[harkirat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSexDI8ZXZY) about Summer of
Bitcoin and how

got into [JAM](https://jamapp.org/) and I was instantly hooked (also the $3000
BTC stipend doesn’t hurt). I started researching about SoB and JAM and they
used the same tech stack as I did (mind you, this was a year ago and I barely
knew React). Plus the mentors were very active; I decided that if I was
applying to SoB then it’d be with them. So I looked at some issues, `git
clone`‘d the project and made my first
[contribution](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam/pull/820). It was a
pretty small change, but [tbk](https://github.com/theborakompanioni) (my SoB
mentor) was super helpful. I slowly made a few more PRs and finally it was the
day to apply for SoB ’25. I submitted my resume and got through the initial
screening (just basic checks) and the 4-week bootcamp began!

**Bootcamp** (_4 weeks_)  
We got 4 problems in total to solve and we needed to finish at least 1 per
week (you can solve and submit them early as well) I tried my best to finish
it as soon as possible so that I wouldn’t feel pressured by the deadline. I
finished the first two relatively quickly within a week and in this period the
SoB discord server was extremely active and I saw a few people who had already
solved all 4 problems.

Texting my friends that I’d not make it.

To be honest I felt that I would probably not make it in (especially since
most of the people who I interacted with were from IITs and had pretty good
experience already) I eventually solved all the tasks and could finally
participate in the proposal round.

I saw the orgs that came and I also contributed to a few of them (You can send
up to 3 proposals to increase your chances of getting selected) but I didn’t
even start with the proposals until there were just 3 days left for the
deadline!!!! I quickly drafted a half-baked proposal (even though I had
planned to write 3 proposals) and the deadline was 5:30 PM but I finished at
5:32 PM and was sweating trying to submit.  
Thankfully [adi](https://x.com/adi_shankara_) didn’t close the portal and
after submitting, I realized I hadn’t added the competency test (each org
gives a competency test just to filter out the majority) I quickly added them
and submitted again. I was relieved that at least one proposal was in; but
when I checked again I saw that there were still a few errors and typos which
I hadn’t noticed.

Pasted the same link twice!

I thought I’m definitely not making it through. JAM was one of the last orgs
to join SoB and also one of the last ones to reveal who they selected, but a
few days later I got this in my inbox

I was pretty thrilled and I waited for a week but I didn’t know where I’m
supposed to communicate with my mentor, so I asked

[apX13](https://medium.com/u/bf1935108391?source=post_page---user_mention--

and he told me that we communicate on Matrix, so when I checked there, I
realized he had already texted me! (This was after I’d already been selected
btw)

My task is to create a new JAM V2 UI from the ground up. The proposal for V2
was to use Tanstack Query and integrate Storybook and to build every single
component and every page using new technologies. The V1 used `Create React
App` and vanilla CSS with `Bootstrap`. My first task was to run a bitcoin node
locally and to check out Lightning Network for which tbk sent me 3000 sats
just for me to check it out which I thought was very cool and completely
changed my perspective about BTC being slow!  
It’s been about a month now and I’ve managed to make some pretty good progress
on my project and the mentors are so chill that it doesn’t even feel like an
internship! ([tbk](https://github.com/theborakompanioni) is the best).  
Hope this was a good read and I’ll update the blog gradually as I hit more
checkpoints and milestones!
