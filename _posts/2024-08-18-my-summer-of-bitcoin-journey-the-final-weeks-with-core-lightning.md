Hello, I’m Raehat Singh Nanda, a Summer of bitcoin 2024 participant, working with the Core Lightning Organization, under the mentorship of Vincenzo Pallazo. I am focusing on the “CLN: Research Project on CLN Pay Plugin.”

In this blog, I’ll go through the last 4 weeks of my Summer of Bitcoin journey.

**WEEK 9 (18 JULY TO 25 JUL)**

I contributed to setting up the testing infrastructure, ensuring it was robust and suitable for our needs. Additionally, I assisted in writing test cases that covered a variety of scenarios, thoroughly testing the payment functionality in the regtest environment to ensure it operated as expected.

**WEEK 10 (26 JULY TO 2 AUG)**

I added functionality to make the amount parameter optional in our plugin, fixed some bugs, wrote code to enable bidirectional channels, and resolved an issue where the gossip map was causing the plugin to crash.

**WEEK 11 & 12 (3 AUG TO 18 AUG)**

I implemented the conversion from LDK route to Barq route output, assisted in fixing some bugs, and helped resolve issues related to integrating LDK into Barq.

I’d like to thank my mentor, Vincenzo Palazzo. I was just a beginner in the Bitcoin open source, with little knowledge about rust (programming language we worked on), but Vincenzo has been super patient with me, and helped me understand a lot of things. He is an excellent mentor who supported me on every step.
