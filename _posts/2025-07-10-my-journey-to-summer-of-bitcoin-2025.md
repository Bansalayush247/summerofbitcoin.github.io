Hey! I am Harsh Dev Pathak, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Babu Banarasi
Das Engineering College with specifications in Full Stack Web Development and
Blockchain Development. I really enjoy working on complex projects solving a
real world problems and contirbuting to open source organizations, learn from
others and push my own boundaries by turning ideas into real. Apart from this
I am a finalist and winner of hackathons HackWeb3Conf & HackFest in my second
year of college.

## **What is SoB:**

**Summer of Bitcoin (SoB)** is a global summer internship program that
introduces university students to open-source development and design focused
on Bitcoin. Students go through several challenging rounds of assignments over
a few weeks, and those who pass get the opportunity to write a proposal for
the listed projects on the official SoB website. These proposals are reviewed
by mentors, and selected students get to contribute to those projects over the
course of the program.

You can find more details about SoB on their [official website
here](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/).

**What I am Working On?**

I have been selected as an SoB intern working at [Fedimint
](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint)while building a [Fedimint web
wallet](https://github.com/Harshdev098/fedimint-web-wallet) which uses
[Chaumian Ecash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash) to custody and Transact
Bitcoin privately.

Earlier in the selection process, I had completed the second round ahead of
the timeline and began researching past organizations. My first preference was
**LDK** , and **Fedimint** was my second. As I dove deeper into the Lightning
Network, I realized how much I wanted to be involved but things didnâ€™t go as
planned. ðŸ˜¥

When the third round began, I kept a close watch on the list of projects â€” and
to my surprise, **Fedimint** , which was my second choice from the beginning,
had a project listed that perfectly aligned with my interests and tech stack
experience: **Building a Fedimint Web Wallet using their**[**Web
SDK**](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint-web-sdk). Despite knowing that it
might be a crowded and competitive project, I committed to it wholeheartedly
because I was truly inspired by the problem they were solving. While I have
contributed to various open-source projects, my experience with Fedimint has
been truly inspiring, how they managed their community and understanding their
contributorâ€™s perspective was truly impressive!.

I started contributing consistently, learning from the existing codebase and
diving into Fedimintâ€™s architecture. After about a month of contributions, I
received feedback and it all paid off. **I got selected for the Fedimint Web
Wallet project!** ðŸŽ‰. You can view my contributions including SoB in Fedimint
[here](https://gist.github.com/Harshdev098/71de9b2ef4a9539ae4f5baf75979058e).

After getting into the program, started to work on building the Fedimint Web
Wallet, interacted with my mentors to get started, shared my views how I will
be accomplishing the work and they have shared their insights about the
project what they want for it to work! From here the Internship started.

Will be sharing more insights about my intership progress!
